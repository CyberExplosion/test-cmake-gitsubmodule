- Helping you to use libraries from Github EASILY, automatic build and download and shit
==> This is the best thing about CMake

# This is mainly a Git feature, that's why we have .git

# Make sure to find some .gitignore C++ and CMake. And also ignore the /build folder

- Using glfw as an example how to use git submodule. Since the project has a top level CMakeLists.txt, we can just put it into another folder and add it onto our top level CMAkeList and it will fit right in

git submodule add https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git external/glfw

- We have an external folder so we can organize multiple submodules

# Make a few scripts to make better so you don't have to type in "cmake -S ..." over an dover again

- Normally it will only build Adder and the main .obj since we haven't add in the submodule libraries yet

- option in Makefiles can be use to change Makefiles behavior

@ Ex, inside the glfw CMakeList.txt:
option(GLFW_BUILD_DOCS "Build the GLFW documentation" ON)

- This is an option that been set default to ON, we can change that to OFF when we CMake because we don't want documentation

cmake -DGLFW_BUILD_DOCS=OFF -S . -B build/
